EJS

- The index.ejs file is the body of the ejs layout file.


Escape vs Unescape

- Copy and past the ejs template found on the overview of ejs here: https://blainerobertson.github.io/340-js/views/ejs.html
- HTML escaped means that when someone submits a piece of html code what is stored in the databse so you would see the html with the tag
- HTML unescaped turns the tag into live html tag
- Notice the markers from the picture that I took in class
